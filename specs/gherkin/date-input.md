## Automated test coverage

```gherkin
Feature: Date input — automated coverage

  Rule: Visual spec matches Figma Date input component

    @automated
    # specs/tests/css/component-specs.test.js
    Scenario: Gap between day/month/year fields
      Given the compiled CSS for .nhsw-date-input
      Then the gap is 0 vertical / 24px horizontal

    @automated
    # specs/tests/css/component-specs.test.js
    Scenario: Label sits close above its input
      Given the compiled CSS for .nhsw-date-input__label
      Then margin-bottom is 4px

  Rule: Every day/month/year field has a real, correctly-associated label

    @automated
    # specs/tests/markup/accessibility.test.js
    Scenario Outline: Visible inputs have an associated label
      Given the "<fixture>" example fixture
      Then every day/month/year input has a <label for> pointing at its id

      Examples:
        | fixture                    |
        | date-input-default.html    |
        | date-input-error-1.html    |
        | date-input-error-2.html    |

    @automated
    # specs/tests/markup/accessibility.test.js
    Scenario Outline: Hint and error text are connected via aria-describedby
      Given the "<fixture>" example fixture
      Then every .nhsw-hint/.nhsw-error-message with an id is referenced by some aria-describedby

      Examples:
        | fixture                    |
        | date-input-default.html    |
        | date-input-error-1.html    |
        | date-input-error-2.html    |

    @automated
    # specs/tests/markup/accessibility.test.js
    Scenario Outline: aria-invalid fields sit alongside a visible error message
      Given the "<fixture>" example fixture
      Then every [aria-invalid="true"] field has a .nhsw-error-message nearby

      Examples:
        | fixture                    |
        | date-input-error-1.html    |
        | date-input-error-2.html    |

    @automated
    # specs/tests/markup/accessibility.test.js
    Scenario Outline: Date inputs are wrapped in fieldset + legend
      Given the "<fixture>" example fixture
      Then every .nhsw-date-input sits inside a <fieldset> with a <legend>

      Examples:
        | fixture                    |
        | date-input-default.html    |
        | date-input-error-1.html    |
        | date-input-error-2.html    |
```

## Manual test scenarios

Practical checks — look at the component and try it, no special tools needed unless noted. Where a check comes from an accessibility guideline, the WCAG reference is included in the scenario name so it's clear why it's there, without needing the full guideline spelled out.

```gherkin
Feature: Date input — manual verification

  @manual
  Scenario: Fields identify their purpose so browsers can offer autofill (WCAG 2.2 SC 1.3.5)
    Given a production date-of-birth date input
    Then day/month/year fields are set up so browsers can offer to autofill them

  @manual
  Scenario: Tabbing moves day, then month, then year
    Given a date input with all three fields
    When a user tabs through it
    Then focus moves day, then month, then year, in that order

  @manual
  Scenario: On multi-question pages, it's clear which question each date belongs to
    Given a page asking more than one question, each with its own date input
    Then each date input's heading clearly says which question it's answering
```
